# Portfolio  

Welcome to my portfolio!

I’m a small-time developer who’s always looking for the next project to build, whether that’s games, tools, or bots. My long-term goal is to grow a community around the things I create while continuously improving my skills as a developer.  

## 👨‍💻 About Me  
-  Passionate about **problem-solving** and turning ideas into real projects.  
-  Skilled in multiple programming languages, with a focus on:  
  - **Roblox Luau** – scripting, AI systems, gameplay mechanics, and modular architecture.
  - **Node.js** – building APIs, Discord bots, and backend services.  
-  I especially love making **Discord bots**, where I get to combine creativity with utility. 

-  Strong at **organizing code** and keeping projects clean, modular, and scalable.  

I believe in writing **compact, efficient, and maintainable code**—whether it’s game scripts or backend services.  

## 🛠️ Skills  
- Roblox Development (Luau, AI systems, modular design, pathfinding)  
- Discord Bot Development (Node.js, API integration, automation tools)  
- Backend Development (Express.js, REST APIs, data handling)  
- Code Architecture & Organization (clean, reusable module design)  

## 📂 Projects  

Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on (more coming soon):  

### HellSpire  
- Designed AI behaviors such as **target selection, pathfinding, and task trees**.  
- Focused on modular, reusable systems for easy scalability across different projects.  

### 🤖 Discord Bots  
- Built multiple bots for moderation, utility, and community engagement.  
- Experienced with **command handling**, **API integrations**, and **event-based systems**.

📌 **Future Goals:**  
- Expand into **web development** and **game engines beyond Roblox**.  
- Build a portfolio of **open-source tools** to help other developers.  
- Grow a **community of developers and players** around my work.
