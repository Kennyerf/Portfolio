# Regianld (Discord Bot)

Regianld was an experimental attempt to integrate a fine-tuned GPT-2 model into a Discord bot so it could perform simple AI-driven tasks. The goal was to explore whether a small, fine-tuned language model could assist with responses and automation inside a server.

Outcome
-------

The experiment was not successful. The GPT-2 fine-tune lacked sufficient training data and examples to produce reliable behavior, so the integration did not work as intended. This repository provides a high-level overview of that effort rather than an in-depth code walkthrough.

Notes
-----

- This README intentionally stays at a project-level overview and does not go deep into implementation details.
- The model used was a fine-tune of GPT-2 and was not fully trained or production-ready.
- If you want to revisit this work, the top priorities are gathering more high-quality training data and adding robust evaluation and testing.

If you'd like, I can add a short section with pointers on how to reattempt fine-tuning or how to migrate to a more modern model (e.g., a smaller GPT-3/4 family or open-source alternatives).
